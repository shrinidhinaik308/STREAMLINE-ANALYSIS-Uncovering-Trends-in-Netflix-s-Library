# STREAMLINE-ANALYSIS-Uncovering-Trends-in-Netflix-s-Library
The Netflix dataset for 2021 has been analysed to gain insights into the platform's content  distribution in terms of genres, content types (movies vs. TV shows), and content ratings. This report  aims to summarize the findings and provide recommendations for future content strategy based on  trends observed in the current dataset.

To implement this project, I utilized Python along with key libraries such as Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib. I began by inspecting and cleaning the dataset, handling missing values, and ensuring the data was structured appropriately for analysis. Using Pandas, I performed data manipulation and exploration, while Seaborn and Matplotlib were employed to create visualizations like bar charts, pie charts, and heatmaps. These visualizations helped uncover insights into content distribution, genre trends, and content ratings on Netflix. Through this approach, I was able to analyze the data effectively and generate meaningful insights to inform future content strategies.
